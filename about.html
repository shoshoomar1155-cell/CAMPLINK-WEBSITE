    <p class="subtitle">
        CampLink is a demo website for student trips, created as a multi-page project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

        <h2>Who is this website for?</h2>
        <p>
            CampLink is designed for school and university students who want to book safe and organized trips such as
            camping, hiking, city visits and cultural tours. The website guides the student from creating an account,
            to completing the profile, choosing a destination and finally confirming the booking.
